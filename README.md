Hello, I’m @Kernivel or Hugo, 24 years old graduated from ISEN Brest and currently working as a Vision and signal processing Engineer at Ecat-iD.
- I’m interested in working more as a software engineer or fullstack developer as I really enjoy creating softwares espacially tools to visualize information or simulations.
- I have been working quite a lot with Python and C++, they're are my goto when buiding something new.
- Right now I have taken an interest in learning Node and React, as I believe having some knowledge on those subjects can be benificial when looking for work.
- I believe I can bring creativity to the table when I'm trying to differentitate myself from others, as I am excited to build visually pleasing sites or applications.
- You can contact me by mail at : hugorevois@gmail.com
