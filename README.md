Hello, I’m @Kernivel or Hugo, 25 years old engineer graduated from ISEN Brest.

I worked as:
- a Vision and signal processing Engineer at Ecat-iD.
- a DBMS Software engineer at Actian

But during my free time I have experimented with:
- Unreal Engine, to create a FPS game
- Blender and Subtance painter, to create models (https://sketchfab.com/amadions)
- Webdev, trough React and JS to create a webapp and a visualisation of Delaunay triangulation (which could act as a very expensive screen saver)
- Some AI Image recognition stuff through TensorFlow and Python to build a tiny software that would solve Sudoku grids automatically.
- LeetCode to learn about data structures and algos (https://leetcode.com/u/Karnaval/)

As of now I am putting a lot of time and efforts into learning game developement, I am passionate about it with the hope that the years I have spent playing games can be mixed with the knowledge I've gathered as an Engineer.
